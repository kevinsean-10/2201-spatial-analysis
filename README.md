This is the syntax used to perform spatial analysis on gold data (Data Andat FIX.xlsx) and predict the potential values of gold within it.

This code includes:

Importing xlsx data and converting it into a spatial point data frame
Creating a scatter plot with the size of the dot indicating the value at that location
Displaying the best variogram model among Exponential, Spherical, and Gaussian.
Performing kriging or predicting the value of gold for an unknown point
Displaying the contour plot of kriging results.
